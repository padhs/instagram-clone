# instagram-clone

This is a clone of Instagram. This was made with React. I chose this project to test and develop my react skills. ðŸ˜‰
After the front-end is done, I will jump into the back-end. 

Nodejs and express for back-end. Using mongodb for storing user data ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. Since this is a clone of the official instagram, users can only post from the mobile app.
Posting is not allowed in this web app. ðŸ˜”
