# instagram-clone

This is a clone of Instagram. This was made with React. I chose this project to test and develop my react skills.
After the front-end is done, I will jump into the back-end.
Using Google's pre-built solution (Firebase) for this project. Firebase also provides authentication along with crash analytics. So thought I should give it a try.
